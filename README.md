# Kocham Gry

This will be a **Next.js MDX blog** about my favourite video games. Stay tuned, I will add more code soon!
I encourage you to take a look at the commit history to see how I improved over the months. There are a lot of commits, because at the begging of my frontend journey I didn't know how to use GIT and GitHub properly, sorry for that :)
